    "# Project 3 - Open Street Map Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Open Street Map is a project to create a open source mapping of the world. It could most easily be understood as the Wikipedia of maps, where anyone in the world can add to the mapping dataset. The data provides a rich dataset, both interesting in the context of learning more about various geographic areas around the world, or from the data itself, such as how many people contributed to the dataset for a particular area. With any project reliant on human input though the data is sometimes inconsistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Los Angeles California\n",
    "Los Angeles California was chosen for two primary reasons. One is that Los Angeles is largest city in America, and the second most populous. It is very likely that there are more records in Los Angeles than most other American cities and it is also likely that there are more contributers. The second reason is that the I was born close to Los Angeles so to me it is a more interesting dataset.\n",
