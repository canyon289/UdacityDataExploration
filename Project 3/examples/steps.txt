1. Iterate through element attributes
Append all attributes into node

Except if in created then append to created dictionary
If Lon or Lat add to position (Ensure they're floats)
If tag is problematic ignore it

if tag starts with addr: add it under address dictionary
if tag starts with addr but has more than one colon ignore it

If way then node refs get turned into an array


Need to iterate over attributes first, then tags later
